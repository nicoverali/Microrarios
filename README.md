A simple Android app for local bus timesðŸšŒâŒ›

## General info

There is a local bus that travels from my city to a neighbor city. The schedule is only available online, so I decided to make an app to not only **access it faster** but also **set notifications** and **calculate arrival times**.

The bus company doesn't provide any API, so I had to extract the schedule from their web and parse the HTML tables.

## Status

Unfortunately, I couldn't finish this app, neither has been published to Google Play Store.
